-- ============================================================================
-- Semantic layer for a Cortex Analyst "chat with your data" page.
-- Two objects: (1) a flattened base VIEW, (2) a single-table SEMANTIC VIEW,
-- plus Cortex Search services for fuzzy literal resolution on string dimensions.
-- Replace <DB>.<SCHEMA>, table/column names, dims and metrics for your data.

-- 1) FLATTEN TO ONE VIEW ------------------------------------------------------
-- Do all joins here, and pre-derive any parsed/computed columns (e.g. regex
-- splits, flags, per-row composite scores). This keeps the semantic view
-- single-table: no relationships to model, simpler + reliable — but you own the
-- grain, so mind fan-out (below).
-- ⚠️ GRAIN & FAN-OUT: decide the ONE row-per-<grain> the view produces and keep
--    the join to it. If a join is one-to-many, rows DUPLICATE and SUM/AVG/COUNT
--    silently double-count. Guards: keep the join at the intended grain (or
--    pre-aggregate the many side first), and count entities with COUNT(DISTINCT).
-- ⚠️ NULLs: NULL dimensions aren't groupable as a visible bucket, and AVG ignores
--    NULL rows. COALESCE dimension values you want to filter/group on.
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW <DB>.<SCHEMA>.<BASE_VIEW>
  COMMENT = 'Flattened base for Cortex Analyst. One row per <grain>.'
AS
SELECT
    f.<key_col>,
    COALESCE(d.<dim_col_a>, 'Unknown') AS <DIM_A>,      -- COALESCE so NULLs are groupable
    d.<dim_col_b>              AS <DIM_B>,
    -- Example derived dimension (parse instead of doing regex per query):
    REGEXP_REPLACE(f.<raw_key>, '<pattern>', '')    AS <DERIVED_DIM>,
    f.<measure_1>,
    f.<measure_2>,
    -- Example per-row composite (also expose the canonical metric below):
    (f.<measure_1> + f.<measure_2> * 10) / 60.0 * 100 AS <COMPOSITE_PER_ROW>
FROM <DB>.<SCHEMA>.<FACT_TABLE> f
JOIN <DB>.<SCHEMA>.<DIM_TABLE>  d ON f.<key_col> = d.<key_col>;

-- 2) CORTEX SEARCH SERVICES (literal resolution) ------------------------------
-- Attach to HIGH-cardinality string dimensions (>10 distinct values) so Analyst
-- maps user phrasing ('cortex search') to the stored value ('Cortex Search').
-- (Snowflake string `=` is CASE-SENSITIVE; without this, mis-cased/worded
-- filters return zero rows.) For LOW cardinality (1-10) use sample values instead.

  AS (SELECT DISTINCT <DIM_A> FROM <DB>.<SCHEMA>.<BASE_VIEW> WHERE <DIM_A> IS NOT NULL);

-- 3) SEMANTIC VIEW ------------------------------------------------------------
-- Dimensions = categorical/filter columns. Metrics = AGGREGATES.
-- ENCODE derived/composite metrics as NAMED metrics so the LLM cannot mis-derive
-- them. Add WITH SYNONYMS + COMMENT to everything to improve NL mapping.
--
-- GOTCHAS:
--   * Per-item COMMENT REQUIRES the `=` sign:  COMMENT = '...'   (COMMENT '...' fails)
--   * Dimension clause ORDER is fixed:
--       <alias>.<name> AS <expr>
--         [ WITH SYNONYMS = (...) ]
--         [ COMMENT = '...' ]
--         [ WITH CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE <fqn> [ USING <col> ] ]   <-- MUST be LAST
--   * Fully-qualify the search-service name (DB.SCHEMA.NAME).

    base.row_count AS COUNT(*) WITH SYNONYMS = ('number of rows')
  )
  COMMENT = '<one-line description of what this model answers>'
